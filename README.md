## Recommendations to Improvement’s

1. Boost Awareness in Low-Sales Regions:
• Some states like Ladakh, Andaman & Nicobar, Sikkim, Chandigarh, Mizoram, 
Tripura, Nagaland and Manipur have low EV adopƟon. More awareness campaigns, 
beƩer charging infrastructure, and local dealership support can help unlock their 
potenƟal.
2. Strengthen the 4-Wheeler & Public Transport Market:
• Since 4-wheelers and buses have low adopƟon, expanding charging staƟons and 
offering beƩer financial incenƟves can encourage more people to switch.
3.Prepare for Seasonal Demand
• Since sales spike in Q4, businesses should increase inventory and markeƟng efforts 
during this period to maximize revenue. 
4. Address the Slowdown in 2024:
• With sales slowing down this year, it’s important to analyze factors like policy 
changes, economic impact, or possible market saturaƟon and take correcƟve 
measures.
